Collection of some of my tasks and project developed for the Data Science Bootcamp by Cogrammar and HyperionDev. 

## [Travel agency](https://github.com/falconeilario/data-science-portfolio/blob/main/travel_agency.py)
This program takes the data from an external .csv file (Flights_info.csv) and manipulate them using Pandas in order to retrieve the information requested from the users.
Users are asked to compose a round trip selecting their preferred flights among the available ones corresponding to their selected departure city, arrival city and departure date.
Users also have to select if they want additional services, such as extra luggage, car rental or travel insurance.
In the end, after collecting all the users' choices, the program shows the trip summary with all the details, the single price of every flight and service and the total cost of the trip.
