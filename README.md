# Data Portfolio
This is a collection of some of my tasks and projects developed for the Data Science Bootcamp by Cogrammar and HyperionDev I am attending.
I'll use this space to monitor my projects, providing concise descriptions of their respective purposes.

## [Marketing Performance Dashboard in Looker Studio](https://github.com/falconeilario/marketing-performance-looker-studio)

In my most recent role, I built a dashboard to track our Growth Marketing activities, marketing channel performance, and deeper insights into our contentâ€”specifically, website traffic, newsletter engagement, and LinkedIn post-performance.
The goal was to have everything in one place, easy to read, and actionable.

The dashboard was built using:
- HubSpot (custom reports)
- Google Sheets (data cleaning and processing)
- Looker Studio (visualization)

## [Travel agency](https://github.com/falconeilario/travel-agency)
This program simulates a Travel agency digital service which allows users who want to go on holiday to look for a round trip flight that suits their needs.
It takes the data from an external .csv file (Flights_info.csv) and manipulate them using Pandas library in order to retrieve the information requested from the users.
Users are asked to compose a round trip selecting their preferred flights among the available ones corresponding to their selected departure city, arrival city and departure date.
Users also need to select additional services, such as extra luggage, car rental or travel insurance.
In the end, after collecting all the users' choices, the program shows the trip summary with all the details, the single price of every flight and service and the total cost of the trip.

The program makes use of:
- Python programming language
- while/for loops
- conditional statements
- user-defined functions
- Pandas library
- data manipulation

## [Data Analysis and Data Visualisation with Python](https://github.com/falconeilario/codingTasks)
The objective of this task is to create graphs using a .csv dataset to explore and analyze the performance of various car models, aiming to answer specific questions based on the data:
- Which of the manufacturers has the car with the highest revs per mile?
- Is it generally more fuel efficient to drive in the city or on the highway?
- What happens when the wheelbase gets larger?
- Does a larger car mean more horsepower?

For this task I used:
- Python programming language
- Pandas library
- Matplotlib library
- Seaborn library
